    <!--    The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet.
            It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.
            In the following example we have three <div> elements with a class attribute with the value of "city".
            All of the three <div> elements will be styled equally according to the .city style definition in the head

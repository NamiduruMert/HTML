        General Information

        ***<link>	Defines the relationship between a document and an external resource

        ***The title should describe the content and the meaning of the page.

            The page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO). The text is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.

            The <title> element:

            defines a title in the browser toolbar
            provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
            displays a title for the page in search engine-results
            So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible!

        ***

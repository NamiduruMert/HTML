    <!--    ***The HTML <q> tag defines a short quotation.

            Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.
            
            ***The HTML <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM".

            Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines.

            Tip: Use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element. 
        
            ***The HTML <address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.

            The contact information can be an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, social media handle, etc.

            The text in the <address> element usually renders in italic, and browsers will always add a line break before and after the <address> element.
        
            ***The HTML <cite> tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.).

            Note: A person's name is not the title of a work.

            The text in the <cite> element usually renders in italic.
        
            ***BDO stands for Bi-Directional Override.

            The HTML <bdo> tag is used to override the current text direction:
